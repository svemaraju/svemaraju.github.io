                    <p>Have you ever experienced buying something online during a sale like Black Friday or you  buying tickets for a popular music festival? </p>
<p>I bet you would have experienced an adrenaline rush as you tried click through the website or app, racing against time and competing with thousands or millions of people at the very same time. </p>
<p>Some of these websites are run by highly reputed software companies that have resources to handle millions of users at a time. But not all tech is built equal. </p>
<h2>How does the booking system work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slots are opened for booking at an announced date and time. The announcement is made on the website and social media. There are many types of services that can be booked and each of them are opened at different times. We will look at one type of service called Special Entry Darshan. "Darshan" is loosely translated to "a viewing" or more precisely it is an opportunity to be in the presence of a God (in a temple).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slots for next month are usually available sometime in the last month of this month. But this is not consistent. By my own personal experience, the slots are opened for next two months are opened on the same day. That means users need to keep monitoring their app or website to stay informed. I haven't used the app so I am not sure if they have any push notifications to notify announcements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are expected to have an account registered on the website with their email and phone number. One can login to the website using phone number and a one-time password sent via SMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's say the bookings are going live at 10AM on Friday. You need to be logged in on the app or website around 2 mins before. Users are auto logged out in 10-15 minutes so you need to be precise. After you have logged in and you click on the Special Entry Darshan from the "Online Services" menu you will be shown a countdown timer. You are essentially in a virtual waiting room to be let in. It seems like the time can vary depending on the traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you are finally in. You see a calendar interface with, hopefully, lots of open slots to book. You will need to select a date and time slot to book tickets. After you enter number of people who are going to attend, you will be redirected to a page that asks you fill in details of each attendee. Therea are 2 dropdowns and 3 free text fields for each attendee. After you fill everything correctly without errors, you get directed to a payment page. There are different options to pay, you select one of them and complete the payment. Finally you are redirected to a success page where you are given a booking reference number and details about how to download the booking confirmation. </p>
