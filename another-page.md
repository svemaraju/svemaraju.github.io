My name is Srikanth Vemaraju. 

I am an aspiring thought sharer and restless thinker. This blog is an attempt to communicate my thoughts and feelings on variety of topics, most of which will not be original. It's an attempt to normalise my thought process and open up about stuff I usually don't get to talk about in my daily life.
